# PrepForge 🤖🎤

PrepForge is an AI-powered mock interview platform built to simulate **real software engineering interviews**. It helps students and early-career engineers improve how they **explain answers**, **think out loud**, and **perform under interview conditions**.

Unlike basic interview chatbots, Intervu.AI focuses on **evaluation, feedback, and realism** — exactly how interviewers assess candidates.

## 🚀 Features

### 1️⃣ Text-Based Interview Practice (Learning Mode)

In this mode, users practice by typing their answers and learning from feedback.

**What the AI does:**

* Asks common **HR, behavioral, and DSA interview questions**
* Evaluates the user’s answer
* Gives a **score out of 10**
* Explains what went well and what was missing
* Rewrites the user’s answer into a **clear, confident, interview-ready version**

**DSA Topics Covered:**

* Arrays & Strings (Two Sum, Sliding Window, Prefix Sum)
* Linked Lists (reverse, cycle detection, middle node)
* Stacks & Queues (valid parentheses, min stack)
* Trees & BST (traversals, validation, LCA)
* Basic Graphs (BFS vs DFS)
* Recursion & Dynamic Programming (basics)
* Time & Space Complexity and optimization

This mode is designed for **learning how to explain answers properly**, not memorizing solutions.

### 2️⃣ Voice & Video Mock Interview (Test Mode)

This mode simulates a **real 45–60 minute interview**, similar to a Google Meet or Zoom interview.

**How it works:**

* AI interviewer asks questions using **voice**
* User responds live using **audio and video**
* Interview includes:

  * Behavioral questions
  * Deep questions about the user’s own projects
  * DSA and problem-solving questions with follow-ups
* No hints or feedback during the interview (just like real interviews)

After the interview ends, the system analyzes the full session and generates a **detailed interview report**.

**Interview Report Includes:**

* Overall interview score (out of 100)
* Section-wise evaluation:

  * Communication skills
  * Behavioral responses
  * Project understanding
  * DSA & problem solving
  * Time & space complexity awareness
  * Confidence and clarity
* Strengths and weaknesses
* Common mistakes
* Final hire recommendation (Strong Hire / Hire / Borderline / No Hire)
* Actionable improvement tips

---

## 🧠 Why PrepForge?

* Simulates **real interviewer behavior**, not generic chat
* Focuses heavily on **DSA reasoning and explanation skills**
* Includes **project-based questioning**, which most platforms ignore
* Combines **learning mode + test mode** in one platform
* Helps users understand **how interviewers actually evaluate candidates**
